Building next-gen AI systems at the intersection of neuroscience, cognition, and large-scale engineering.



# 👋 Hi — I'm Sujal
*Software engineer · researcher-adjacent · builder of improbable things*

> I build at the intersection of code, minds, and possibility.

## ✨ Quick facts
- 🔭 Currently exploring: distributed systems, deep learning primitives, and computational neuroscience curiosities  
- 🧠 Research curiosity: how algorithms can mirror — and extend — cognitive processes  
- 🚀 Interests: AI systems, elegant abstractions, product-forging, and speculative tech that nudges reality  
- 🛠️ Tools: (see `Skills` below — honest, portable, battle-tested list)

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Tech
- **Languages:** Python · TypeScript · Go · Rust (practical + poetic)  
- **Systems:** Kubernetes · Docker · Terraform · gRPC · high-throughput pipelines  
- **ML / Research:** PyTorch · JAX · Hugging Face · experimental modeling  
- **Data & infra:** Kafka · Cassandra · Postgres · Redis · observability stacks

## 🌌 The manifesto (short)
I favour clarity over cleverness, experiments over assumptions, and systems that scale both in users and in imagination. Code is a scaffold for ideas — and ideas should be daring.

## 🧪 Selected Projects
> Paste links to repos below (replace the example names). Keep each project entry to 1–2 lines.

- **project-aurora** — distributed inference scaffold for low-latency models. `🚧 experimental`  
- **cortex-sim** — small-scale neural dynamics simulator + visualizer (research prototype).  
- **ops-automaton** — infra-as-code patterns, reusable blueprints for cloud-native teams.

## 🧭 Research + Thinking
Short, discoverable notes live in `/notebooks` and `/papers`. If you want a single signal: I experiment with hybrid symbolic/connectionist pipelines and practical interpretability.

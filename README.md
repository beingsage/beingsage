Building next-gen AI systems at the intersection of neuroscience, cognition, and large-scale engineering.

---

## 📬 Want to collaborate?
If you're building something that wants systems, scale, or a curious brain to prod at the edges — open an issue, ping me on GitHub, or email `your.email@example.com`.

---

## 🔧 How to customize quickly
1. Rename this repo to your exact GitHub username (e.g., `YOUR_USERNAME`).  
2. Replace all `YOUR_USERNAME` placeholders with your GitHub username.  
3. Replace `your.email@example.com` with an email you want to show (or remove it).  
4. Fill the Projects section with live repo links.  
5. Commit & push — your profile page will show this README automatically.

## 🛰️ Final note
This README is a scaffold — a loud, generous signal to humans, coders, and curious machines. Make it yours: shorten, expand, or turn it into a manifesto for whatever you want to build next.

## ✨ Quick facts
- 🔭 Currently exploring: distributed systems, deep learning primitives, and computational neuroscience curiosities  
- 🧠 Research curiosity: how algorithms can mirror — and extend — cognitive processes  
- 🚀 Interests: AI systems, elegant abstractions, product-forging, and speculative tech that nudges reality  
- 🛠️ Tools: (see `Skills` below — honest, portable, battle-tested list)

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Tech
- **Languages:** Python · TypeScript · Go · Rust (practical + poetic)  
- **Systems:** Kubernetes · Docker · Terraform · gRPC · high-throughput pipelines  
- **ML / Research:** PyTorch · JAX · Hugging Face · experimental modeling  
- **Data & infra:** Kafka · Cassandra · Postgres · Redis · observability stacks

## 🌌 The manifesto (short)
I favour clarity over cleverness, experiments over assumptions, and systems that scale both in users and in imagination. Code is a scaffold for ideas — and ideas should be daring.

## 🧪 Selected Projects
> Paste links to repos below (replace the example names). Keep each project entry to 1–2 lines.

- **project-aurora** — distributed inference scaffold for low-latency models. `🚧 experimental`  
- **cortex-sim** — small-scale neural dynamics simulator + visualizer (research prototype).  
- **ops-automaton** — infra-as-code patterns, reusable blueprints for cloud-native teams.

## 🧭 Research + Thinking
Short, discoverable notes live in `/notebooks` and `/papers`. If you want a single signal: I experiment with hybrid symbolic/connectionist pipelines and practical interpretability.

## 🪄 A little theatre (because profiles can be fun)
